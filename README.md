    <b>Prerequisites</b>
  </summary>

  - Godot 4.5.x+
  - [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

    <b>Guides</b>
  </summary>

  Got lost? Here's some generally (though non-specific) useful resources.

  - [Official Godot Engine Documentation]: in addition to documentation for the
    engine's features, you'll find a comprehensive set of tutorials, resources,
    and guides available.
  - [Additional Godot learning resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html)
  - [git - the simple guide - no deep s#!t]: straight to the point tutorial on how to use 
    Git on a new blank project but works well as a reference guide too.
  - [The Catalog of Design Patterns]: Or what exactly does this person mean when they say
    things such as "observers", "factory methods", etc. Not crucial to know, just
    something to look up in case of confusion.
